## Project file

A project file is the file in which all of the files attending to the project are listed.
Files having extension .bep or .pro are recognized as a project file by BE editor.

### How to generate project file

You can easily make project file like:

    $ ls *.h *.c *.cpp >my_proj.bep

or

    $ find >my_proj.bep

### How to use Project file

You can load all of the files in your project by passing project file to BE editor, like:

    $ be my_proj.bep

Qt project file (e.g. my_proj.pro) can be used as BE project file.

    $ be my_proj.pro

## The largest file size editable

BE editor loads files on memory.
The size of the largest editable file depends on the memory available.
The maximum file size loadable is about half the memory available.
