- [x] 251115 fill spaces until the column in which previously positioned
- [x] 251105 add get_ef_name() to get "EF_????"
- [x] 251101 dof_select_all_regular_files() does select only regular files
- [x] 251026 incorrect title bar color when screen resizing

- [] sometimes `dir_history` and `file_history` becomes 0 in file size
  - It's unknown why and How to reproduce.
- [x] 250923 "BE_EDITOR{{{{" is not properly output in SSH session
  [Local-PC]                [SSH-server]
  console:KB >-------(SSH)--> stdin:be
  console:Display <--(SSH)--< stdout:be
                        file< stderr:be
  - `be` output "BE_..." message to stdout
- [x] safely trash directory `dir` into ~/.betrash/dirs/dir
- [x] add the directory to the dir_history when you stay in a directory very long period(more than one minute)
  - [x] 251018 change removing temporary registration to remove only the latest entry.
- [x] make it possible to copy a history line to system clip-board in list mode
- [x] make it possible to copy a file name or a path to system clip-board in filer
      ==> K_S_F07: clip file name, K_S_F08: clip file path
- [x] dir_history: integrate two formats of /path/to/dir and /path/to/dir/ to the later format.
- [x] Too long prompt

- [x] 250902 "Changed current dir to: " ==> "Chdir to [...]" and show real dir path soon on status bar
- [x] 250902 use file_history for changing dir by partial dir path
      - [x] separate_path_to_dir_and_file("file") ==> XX("./", "file") ==> OO("", "file")

- [x] 250827 writing to file thru symlink shall write to a destination file
  - [x] 250827 open in full_path(not real_path)
  - [x] 250827 backup and write to the real_path
  - [x] 250826 load_file_name__() convert file-path to abs-path before open a file
     ==> get_abs_path() ==> get_full_path()
- [-] 250825 change directory completing a partial path to a full path by dir_history
      ==> realized but not efficient because paths in file_history are not used
- [x] output BE_EDITOR{{{{ and BE_EDITOR}}}} keywords to cut ANSI-ESCaped texts
- [x] 250810 "drop to copy(K_M_c), move(K_M_m)" does not work
- [x] 250807 update dir-history only when some operation actually done in the dir
  - [x] this is sometimes inconvenient. how to improve it
    - temporarily add dir to history file
      - [x]on changing cur dir to another
        - [x] if the path still exist in history buffer, remove it in the last line
      - [x]on the operation in the dir
        - [x] add the path in history buffer
  - [x] BUG: sometimes dir not registered after I enter and open project file
//- [-] handle a path which contain special character in the state of quoted
//  "/path/to/dir-or-file" ==> "/path/to/dir-or-file"   (as it is)
//  "/path/to/dir or file" ==> "'/path/to/dir or file'" (in quoted string)
- [x] append `/` to a directory path `/path/to/dir` ==> `/path/to/dir/`
  - [ ] when input
  - [ ] when concatinating
  - [x] when executing `cp` and `mv` command
- [L] Make easy to use for other people

- [x] 250620 a line-cut text in another instance is pasted as one-line-cut text
- [x] 250620 in cut_buffer view, text are shown marked
- [x] 250620 wrongly changeable cut-mode in viewing cut_buffer
- [-] 250620 doing `copy` to cut_buffer when viewing cut_buffer causes crash on app because `copy` changes cut_buffer
- [-] 250620 when viewing, wrongly cut/copy/paste-able in cut_buffer
      - cut_buffer is updated even when you are viewing it
      - cut_buffer is automatically reloaded even when you are viewing it
- [x] add expiration timer of 1000mSec to cut_buffer
- [x] ISSUE: Slow bracket search
  - in What case, slows down ?
    - update_screen_app() with bracket HL
    - many files loaded in editor
    - bracket HL
      ==> in `disp_edit_win_bracket_hl_dir_fw()` and `disp_edit_win_bracket_hl_dir_bw()`, so many useless looping
- [x] BUG: share cut_buffer among editor instances.
  - before update local cut_buffer, if the cut_buffer file is newer and reload it.
  - after updated local cut_buffer, if the local cut_buffer is newer and write it.
  - [x] apply the same policy to history_buffer

USB bootable Linux can be a killer application to Windose.
USB からブート可能なOS(Linux)は、きっとWindoseに対するキラーアプリになる。

Linux は便利な利用法としてUSBディスクからのブートが可能である。
しかし、M$ は Linux のこの利便性を真似する事が出来ない。
なぜなら、そうすることは彼らのもっとも重要なソフトウエア製品の野放図な使用を
許すことになってしまうからである。

M$のソフトウエアはPCにインストール後、ソフトウエア・アクティベーションを行う必要がある。
アクティベートされたソフトウエアは異なるコンピュータ上で実行できない様になっている。
LANチップ中のMACアドレスや、CPUやマザーボードのシリアルNo.などを記憶し、
それらが変わった時は異なるPC上で実行されたと判断し、使用できなくしている。
そうする事によって、彼らの製品の野放図な使用を行えなくしているのだ。

ソフトウエア・アクティベーションの回数はM$の社内でカウントされていて、
可能なアクティベーションの回数は3回とか5回とかに制限されている。
